# Collatz-Conjecture-Calculator

Program requirements In order to replicate program:

 You must have a recursive function in your program to calculate 3n+1.
 If you run threeN with no parameters, the program will ask you for a starting number. The user will type in a
positive integer at that prompt and the program will calculate and print the 3n+1 results.
 If you run threeN with integer parameters on the command line, the program will calculate and display the 3n+1
results for each number.
 If the program experiences integer overflow, it will throw an exception in the recursive function. The exception
will be caught in the main function and the program will continue processing the next input number – it will not
crash
 You also need to print out the steps of each starting number as well as these five 3n+1 stats as shown in the
examples below: start, steps, max, odds, evens.
